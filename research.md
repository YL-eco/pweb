          I study the persistent effects of the 1932â€“34 famine in Ukraine. Exploiting exogenous weather shocks and selecting the strongest predictor of famine intensity, I show that: (i) regions with greater famine exposure are less integrated into international trade and exhibit higher within-region inequality, with effects on trade more pronounced for exports than imports; (ii) famine exposure significantly reduces import activity with Russia, though the decline is compensated by increased imports from China, the United States, and the European Union; (iii) famine exposure is associated with a more salient Ukrainian identity, often incompatible with alternative identities such as Russian, Eastern Slavic, or religious affiliationsâ€”helping explain the rupture in import ties; (iv) individuals in more severely affected regions remain trapped in poorer economic conditions and are less likely to be politically active, contributing to export underperformance due to reduced economic competitiveness; (v) empirical evidence on intergenerational transmission confirms theoretical predictions, underscoring the role of the political environment in shaping cultural value persistence; and (vi) education programs are likely among the key mechanisms through which these long-term effects are sustained. The results are robust to classical IV diagnostics, placebo tests, migration correction, and falsification tests using randomly generated outcome variables with identical spatial distribution.

        <p>
          I develop a dynamic model to study the interaction between intergenerational cultural value transmission and the elite's choice of regime ideology. The model allows regimes to be stationary, time-varying, and ultimately endogenously chosen by elites. I first show that, under any regime choice, the initial distribution of cultural values will almost surely lead to the extinction of one value. I then analyze a two-period regime sequence, demonstrating that the duration of the initial regime is critical in preventing ideological backlash when institutions change. I characterize the minimum duration required for early-period policymakers to ensure that their preferred cultural value dominates in the long run, regardless of future regime shifts. Finally, I endogenize regime choice by modeling elite preferences, showing how the initial cultural allocation determines whether long-term policy stabilizes or cycles, causing fluctuations in the dominant cultural value.

          We investigate the shock suffered by the primary sector in Syria following the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011. We incorporate remote sensing datasets with machine learning (ML) to surmount data unavailability in weak-governance environments and evaluate the agricultural shock while armed conflict is still ongoing. We split our analysis locally and at larger areas. Using Staggered Difference-in-Differences (SDID) at patch level (local), we find temporary negative war effects on agricultural activities for zones directly affected by combats, lasting only in the short run (about 5 years). We also note anticipatory effects in the form of preventive migration flows. We then adopt a patch-donuts strategy to quantify spillovers in territories indirectly affected. Externalities are persistently negative, suggesting policymakers should aid both conflict-localities and adjacent areas. We are unable to quantify the maximal spillover effect due to insufficient construction. Lastly, at sub-district level we run Two-Way Fixed Effects and IV (using distance to closest city as instrument) to gauge impacts that embed local equilibrium effects. There is suggestive evidence of conflict-related damages to agriculture, especially when the Syrian State is involved in threatening military operations.

  <h3>Cognitive richness, learning models, and evolutionarily stable Berkâ€“Nash equilibrium</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Summary.</strong>
    Real-world decision making often entails bounded rationality due to feasibility restrictions of mental models.
    I adapt the classical Berkâ€“Nash equilibrium in decision making and augment it with cognitive richness
    (the volume of mental models) and learning of alternative models.
    This setting allows me to characterize evolutionarily stable distributions over the product measure
    of reference frames and cognitive richness under different objective environments.
    Being mentally rich bears incremental costs over task volume and therefore negatively affects fitness.
    Finally, I apply the equilibrium definition across various types of applications.

  <h3>Behavioral selection of immigrants</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Summary.</strong>
    I develop theory explaining how behavioral characteristics shape migration decisions, beyond wages and migration costs.
    I adapt a method using survey data to rank individuals along behaviorally relevant dimensions.
    Using WVS, ESS, Afrobarometer, and EVS, I empirically verify migration decisions and quantify how behavioral
    costs and benefits distort choices relative to purely monetary returns.
